# Goal Tracker

## About This Project

After watching [VIDEO_URL], I was inspired to take a more structured approach to tracking my goals. As both an exercise in building with modern web technologies and a way to document my journey, I decided to create this goal-tracking tool.

This project serves a dual purpose: it's a practical application to help me stay accountable to my goals, and it's also a learning experience where I'm documenting my development process and progress.

## Current Status

Right now, this is a simple data display application built with Next.js 15, React 19, and TypeScript. It uses mock data to demonstrate the UI and basic functionality.

## Future Vision

I plan to expand this tool to:
- Track my personal goals and their progress over time
- Document the steps I've planned for achieving each goal
- Record milestones and progress updates
- Create a visual representation of my journey toward completing my goals

This README will be updated as the project evolves.

## Getting Started

This project uses pnpm as the package manager.

First, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
