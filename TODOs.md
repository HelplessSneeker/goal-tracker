This document tracks the implementation progress and remaining work for the goal tracking system.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27

---

## Current Status

**Branch:** `authentication`

**Architecture:** Server Actions + Service Layer (migrated from API routes)

**Test Status:** ‚úÖ 228/228 tests passing (~7.4s, 100% service coverage)

**Completed:**
- Goals, Regions, Tasks (CRUD with Server Actions + Service Layer)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM with UUID primary keys
- NextAuth.js authentication (email/magic link, JWT sessions)
- Comprehensive test coverage (actions, services, components)

**Next:** Weekly Tasks and Progress Entries implementation

---

## Overview

The system follows a 4-level hierarchy:
- **Goal** ‚Üí **Region** ‚Üí **Task** ‚Üí **Weekly Task** ‚Üí **Progress Entry**

## Completed Work ‚úÖ

**Phases 1-4 Complete** (Goals, Regions, Tasks, Database, Authentication)

- ‚úÖ **CRUD Operations:** Goals, Regions, Tasks with full UI
- ‚úÖ **Architecture:** Server Actions + Service Layer (migrated from API routes)
  - Actions: `app/actions/goals.ts`, `regions.ts`, `tasks.ts`
  - Services: `lib/services/goals.service.ts`, `regions.service.ts`, `tasks.service.ts`
- ‚úÖ **Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM with UUID primary keys
- ‚úÖ **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with email provider, JWT sessions, middleware protection
- ‚úÖ **Testing:** 228/228 tests passing (actions, services, components, auth)
