# TODOs - Goal Tracker Implementation Roadmap

This document tracks the remaining work needed to complete the goal tracking system.

## Overview

The system follows a 4-level hierarchy:
- **Goal** ‚Üí **Region** ‚Üí **Task** ‚Üí **Weekly Task** ‚Üí **Progress Entry**

## Phase 1: Complete Goals & Regions (Foundation) ‚è≥
