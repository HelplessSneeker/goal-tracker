## Phase 9: Data Persistence ‚úÖ COMPLETE

~~Currently using in-memory mock data. Need real persistence.~~

### Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] Choose persistence strategy ‚Üí **PostgreSQL + Prisma**
- [x] Set up database/storage ‚Üí Docker Compose with PostgreSQL
- [x] Create database schema ‚Üí Prisma schema with UUID primary keys
- [x] Update all API routes to use Prisma ‚Üí Goals, Regions, Tasks complete
- [x] Create seed file for development data
- [x] Update all API tests to use Prisma mocks
- [x] Document database setup in README.md

**Completed:** 2025-10-21

- All 58 API tests updated to mock Prisma client
- 100% API test coverage maintained

---

## Phase 10: Authentication & User Management üîê

**Priority: HIGH** - Must be implemented before Weekly Tasks to avoid technical debt.

### Why Now?
- All current database models have `userId` fields (currently using placeholder `0`)
- Implementing auth now prevents massive refactoring later
- Weekly Tasks and Progress Entries will depend on user context
- Multi-tenancy considerations must be established early

### Authentication Strategy
- [ ] Choose auth provider
  - Options: NextAuth.js, Clerk, Auth0, Supabase Auth
  - Recommendation: **NextAuth.js** (integrates well with Next.js 15)
- [ ] Set up authentication
  - [ ] Configure auth provider
  - [ ] Add login/signup pages
  - [ ] Implement session management
  - [ ] Add protected route middleware
- [ ] Update database schema
  - [ ] Add User model to Prisma schema
  - [ ] Add user relations to Goal, Region, Task models
  - [ ] Create migration for existing data
- [ ] Update API routes
  - [ ] Add user authentication checks
  - [ ] Filter queries by userId
  - [ ] Prevent cross-user data access
  - [ ] Update API tests to handle user context
- [ ] Update UI
  - [ ] Add user profile menu
  - [ ] Add login/logout functionality
  - [ ] Show user-specific data only
  - [ ] Add user settings page

### User Model Design
```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
  image     String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  goals     Goal[]
  regions   Region[]
  tasks     Task[]
  // weeklyTasks WeeklyTask[] (when implemented)
  // progressEntries ProgressEntry[] (when implemented)
}
```

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Implement row-level security (user can only access their data)
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Secure session storage
- [ ] Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [ ] Email verification (optional)

---

## Phase 11: Advanced Features (Nice to Have) üöÄ

### Analytics & Insights
- [ ] Completion rate tracking
- [ ] Time to completion statistics
- [ ] Goal progress visualization
- [ ] Weekly/monthly reports
- [ ] Streaks and achievements

### Collaboration (if multi-user)
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Shared goals
- [ ] Comments on tasks
- [ ] Activity feed

### Customization
- [ ] Theme selection (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Custom color schemes
- [ ] Configurable week start day
- [ ] Notification preferences

### Export & Sharing
- [ ] Export goals/progress as Markdown
- [ ] PDF reports
- [ ] Share goals publicly
- [ ] Calendar integration (iCal export)

---

## Bug Fixes & Tech Debt üêõ

- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Add API rate limiting (if needed)

### Low Priority (Future)
- [ ] Security audit (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Bundle size optimization
